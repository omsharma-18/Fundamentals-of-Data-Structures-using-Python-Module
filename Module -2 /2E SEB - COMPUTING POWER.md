### AIM  
To write a function which takes three arguments: a and b and c and returns the addition of them: a+b+c. Assign it to a variable named: f. using python.

---

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.
2. Define a function (e.g., add_three) that accepts three parameters: a, b, and c.
3. Inside the function, calculate the sum of the three inputs (a + b + c).
4. Return the calculated sum from the function.
5. Assign the defined function to the variable named f.
6. (Demonstration) Call the variable f with three example numbers to execute the function.
7. (Demonstration) Print the result returned by the function.
8. Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM

```python
f=lambda a,b,c:a+b+c
x,y,z=int(input()),int(input()),int(input())
print(f(x,y,z))
```

### RESULT
Therefore, the output is the example to write a function which takes three arguments: a and b and c and returns the addition of them: a+b+c. Assign it to a variable named: f. using python.
